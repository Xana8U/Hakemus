#Hakemus  

This is for a Django project made as a job application.

The app is based on django tutorial01 with questions and percentages on results, it is extremely simplified without admin UI.

Job application is the part Hakemus, which is a question poll page which has three questions that you can answer and will show you the results of all votes.

chat is a base of a possible chat application, really raw, no best practices yet(flood control, saved users, auto fields, iframe, etc), it also contains very interesting messages ;)

polls is the tutorial01 provided by Django.(non- debugged version)
